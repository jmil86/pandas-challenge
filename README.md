*Summary of Analysis*

Charter Schools Show Stronger Results: Charter schools consistently had higher results in nearly every category over District schools.

Budget not a major contributor to success: There was not a strong correlation with higher budgets to higher success rates. Some schools with lower budgets outperormed those with higher ones. 

School Size also not a major contributor to success: High-performing schools were found across all size categories, and similarly, underperforming schools existed within each size group.


*Conclusions*

Charter Schools may be more effective than District Schools: The higher success rates of Charter Schools suggests that their approach to education is more effective than Districs.

Higher Budgest Does Not Equal Greater Success: High budgets did not have a significant impact on higher success rates, which suggests a high level in the quality of teachers and school leadership. Students overall seem to thrive in Charter schools of all budget types over District schools, also of all budget types.
